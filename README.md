# Dorm Mart: The Complete Student Marketplace

Dorm Mart is a student-to-student marketplace
that makes it effortless to buy and sell campus
essentials—textbooks, dorm gear, electronics, and
more. Create listings in minutes, track interest
and views, and manage sales from a clean,
mobile-friendly dashboard. Built for safety and
simplicity, Dorm Mart helps students save money,
reduce waste, and find what they need
within a familiar, school-centered community
experience.

With instant messaging and a review system, students can communicate
safely and build trust within their campus network. The platform
supports everything from wishlists to scheduled purchases,
making it easy to coordinate pickups and manage your entire selling
workflow in one place!
