# Backend API Documentation

## What This Is

This is a quick map of the current PHP `api/` tree. Endpoint folders and PHP files use `snake_case`; see `naming-conventions.md` for the naming rules.

## auth/

User sessions, account creation, login, logout, CSRF, WebSocket auth tokens, and password reset flows.

- `auth_handle.php` - Shared login/session helpers, including `require_login()`.
- `create_account.php`, `login.php`, `logout.php`, `me.php` - Core account/session endpoints.
- `change_password.php`, `forgot_password.php`, `reset_password.php`, `validate_reset_token.php` - Password change and reset endpoints.
- `get_csrf_token.php`, `ws_token.php` - Security/token helpers.

## chat/

Conversation and message endpoints used by the React chat UI.

- `ensure_conversation.php`, `fetch_conversations.php`, `fetch_conversation.php`, `fetch_new_messages.php` - Conversation loading.
- `create_message.php`, `create_image_message.php`, `serve_chat_image.php` - Message creation and image serving.
- `delete_conversation.php`, `fetch_unread_messages.php`, `typing_status.php` - Chat state helpers.

## commerce flows

Selling, buying, scheduled purchases, receipts, and purchase history.

- `seller_dashboard/` - Seller listing management, listing deletion, product editing, and status updates.
- `scheduled_purchases/` - Create, list, accept/decline, cancel, and expire scheduled purchase requests.
- `confirm_purchases/` - Seller confirmation requests and buyer responses for completed/failed purchases.
- `receipt/view_receipt.php` - Receipt detail payload for product or confirmation request.
- `purchase_history/` - Purchase history list and transacted item test endpoint.
- `product/view_product.php`, `product/get_item_info.php` - Product detail endpoints.
- `listings/landing_listings.php`, `search/get_search_items.php` - Browse and search listing endpoints.

## user data

Profile, preferences, reviews, wishlist, notifications, and category data.

- `profile/` - Current profile, public profile, username lookup, profile updates, profile photo upload, and user preferences.
- `reviews/` - Product reviews, buyer ratings, review lookup, and review image upload.
- `wishlist/` - Wishlist add/remove/status/list endpoints plus unread notification tracking.
- `user/me.php` - Lightweight landing-page user payload.
- `utility/get_categories.php`, `utility/get_active_categories.php`, `utility/categories.json` - Category data.

## infrastructure

Shared backend support code.

- `database/` - Database connection, schema migration, data migration, and DB test script.
- `security/security.php` - Security headers, CORS, sanitization helpers, and rate-limit support.
- `helpers/request.php`, `helpers/response.php` - Shared request/response helpers.
- `config/app_config.php`, `config/email_config.php`, `config/email_policy.php` - Environment-backed app configuration and allowed-domain policy.
- `media/image.php` - Safe image proxy for uploaded or stored media paths.
- `redirects/` - Password reset redirect and expired-link page.
- `utility/` - CLI/admin helpers for hashing, lockouts, rate-limit inspection, environment loading, and transactional email HTML.

## api_test_files/

Manual and integration-style scripts that call real endpoints. Use `API_TEST_BASE_URL` when the default local API base is not correct.

- `bootstrap.php` - Shared API test helpers.
- `chris/` - Purchase history and reset-password scenario scripts.
- `sameer/` - Forgot-password, SQL injection, XSS, and rate-limit scripts.

## Security Notes

- Most app endpoints include `security/security.php` for headers and CORS.
- Authenticated endpoints use `require_login()` from `auth/auth_handle.php`.
- Password reset links are generated from `API_BASE_URL` and redirected to `FRONTEND_BASE_URL`.
- CORS uses `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`; deployment-specific origins should not be hardcoded in endpoints.
- Developer/admin utility scripts should stay CLI-only unless explicitly designed for browser use.
